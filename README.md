# Chatbot
created a chatbott using botpress
Step 1 : signed up for a botpress tool.

step 2 : created a blank chatbot using scratch.

step 3 : started with manual welcome node.

step 4 : created multiple standard notes incorporating the data as manual answers.

step 5 : created knowledge base for the chatbot

step 6 : Trained the chatbot on provided data on the knowledge base.

step 7 : created another knowledge base and connected it for the web search for live data scrapping
.
step 8 : Enabled the AI expression.


# Power BI Data Visualization
I have created the Visualization report of a cookie company for three years of sales, profit, risks, monthly and yearly revenue, and overall business overview through visualization
of the data found in their sheets.

Step 1:   Gathered data from different sources i.e database, website and inventory regional files.

step 2:   Cleaned the data using Power Query and Excel.

Step 3:   Loaded all data sets into Power Query Editor for initial learning, where I cleaned all unnecessary  columns, handled missing data, and standarized 
formats.

Step 4:  Applied transformation such as filtering rows , splitting columns, and creating calculated columns.

Step 5:  Used merge and append functions to combine the tables ensuring  a seamless link between datasets for a holistic view of sales 
and customer insights.

Step 6:  Performed Data Modeling, and established relationships between tables to enable chats.

Step 7:  Created Visualizations. Presented sales data in a donut chart, showing the sum of units sold by country..

Step 8:  Presented the Sum of revenue by Date and location in a beautiful clustered bar stacked bar chart.

Step 9:  Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the sum of profit by location.

Step 10:  Added a table at the top of the dashboard to present an overview of all the data visualizations we created, including country name, date, day 
time, the sum of profits, units sold, product name, and the sum of revenue.

Step 11: We added a slicer at the top right corner to select location-wise data for each visual we created.

Step 12:  Then I created a live dynamic Map visual we created.

Step 13:  Step 13: Added a Slicer on page 1 to select country wise data with a single click.

Step 14: I created a colorful pie chart to show our monthly and yearly revenue by date.

Step 15: To visualize the yearly profit by date I created a Line Chart to easily see profit date-wise.

Step 16: We created a Mobile App version and a Web App dashboard to present data to our client easily on both platforms.

# NumPy Project Module 2
Introduction
This project demonstrates how to clean a dataset with missing values and calculate basic statistics (mean, maximum, and minimum) using Python and the NumPy library. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each step, from setting up the data to the final analysis.

Step 1: Setting Up the Project
Import Libraries:
First, I imported the necessary library, NumPy, which provides powerful tools for numerical data manipulation and analysis.

Step 2: Initializing the Data
Creating the Dataset:
I created a dataset with sample scores and introduced a few missing values. Missing values were represented as None to simulate incomplete data.

Step 3: Filtering Out Missing Values
Handling Missing Data:
To calculate an average without including missing values, I filtered out None values from the dataset. This allowed me to compute the mean of the available scores accurately.

Step 4: Calculating the Average Score
Finding the Mean of the Filtered Data:
With the filtered dataset, I calculated the average (mean) score, which would later be used to fill in the missing values.

Step 5: Replacing Missing Values
Filling Missing Values with the Mean:
I replaced all None values in the original dataset with the calculated average. This resulted in a "cleaned" dataset with no missing values.

Step 6: Calculating Basic Statistics
Finding Mean, Maximum, and Minimum of Cleaned Data:
I used NumPy functions to calculate key statistics on the cleaned dataset. These included:
Mean: The overall average score
Maximum: The highest score
Minimum: The lowest score

Step 7: Displaying the Results
Printing the Results:
Finally, I printed the calculated mean, maximum, and minimum scores to display a summary of the cleaned data.

Conclusion
In this project, I successfully:

Created a dataset with missing values.
Replaced missing values with the mean to complete the dataset.
Used NumPy to calculate key statistical metrics.
This project highlights my ability to handle missing data, clean datasets, and extract useful insights using basic statistical functions in Python.

Future Improvements
To expand on this project, I could:

Add visualizations of the cleaned data.
Experiment with different methods to handle missing data
